Since I get 498567 queries a day about "Heyyy I'm going to Milan for some days,
since you lived there you tell me some awesome places to get actual Italian
food", I figured it would be much more efficient to write down all the
recommendations (spoiler: I think it's hard to find "proper Italian food" in
Milan, as you're better off going to small towns for that, but I'll do my best
in here) in a place I can point everyone to. So, here we are.

This is intended to be a living document, so if you have any
suggestions/corrections, just [bother me here](https://twitter.com/fabferrai),
or [open a Pull Request](https://github.com/f-f/f-f.github.io), and we'll fix
it.

_Note_: the following sections are in no particular order, just pick some or
read through all of them.

_Disclaimer_: I'm not affiliated with any of this places (yet. I mean if you
want me to sponsor your place let's talk, but if you have good stuff I'll
happily send people your way anyways), all of this is just unconditional love
for the good food.

## Eating

### Pizza

I mean, of course. This is the first thing you want to do when you get in the
city üçï.

- So, the best pizza in town in my opinion is [Pizza
  Am](https://goo.gl/maps/JvPRBmGpz4L2). Their selection is really limited (I
think they have margherita and a couple more pizzas), but a good margherita is
the only thing you actually need and want, so this is good.
- If you're around Citt√† Studi (probably the area I know best, since I spent
  there most of the time) there is also a fairly good and affordable pizzeria:
[Il Postino](https://goo.gl/maps/XbvdvKqnYVC2). The selection is perfect, not
too many, and all fairly "traditional".

### Breweries

I like breweries I guess. And I think Milan is a good place for this kind of
"frank" (as in no-bullshit) but really well-designed breweries (something about
the city being a capital of design but also a really practical place where
people do things, but I digress). So here's my favorites:
- Near the Central Railway Station there is
  [Baladin](https://goo.gl/maps/aKYbM7447Bx). Really good beer (if you're into
open source you have to get an Open, which is, well, open source), really good
burgers and salads and meat dishes, 10/10. That area is also super nice to walk
in, as it's quickly becoming the downtown.  In the area there is really nice
buildings, a notable one is [Bosco Verticale](https://goo.gl/maps/HJ7y64P3uyu),
look around for it.  And there is also a very nice Neapolitan coffee place
[nearby](https://goo.gl/maps/SpETBCDjhXP2).
- My other favorite is [Birrificio Lambrate](http://birrificiolambrate.com/en/).
  There is two of them, so you want to go to [the big
one](https://goo.gl/maps/Go7QMSREFgL2) if you want to have lunch/dinner, and to
[the smaller but older one](https://goo.gl/maps/NsZekd6Ugaz) for a more
authentic brewery experience (they brew just next door, so it's truly a 0km
product). Amazing beer (my usual picks: Domm (weizen) and St.Ambroeus (golden
ale)) and amazing food, 10/10.

### Other food

- **Japanese**: Milan totally loves sushi (or it might be my bubble. But there
  is really many sushi places, so someone must go there). The best sushi in town
to my knowledge is [Poporoya](https://goo.gl/maps/PPNRLqCDGyk). It's a truly old
Japanese shop, really small (like, 15 seats?), with a no-reservations policy and
of course always super crowded, so probably best to avoid peak time (12am). But
the stuff is _really_ good, and service is fast.  For a fancier and less crowded
setting, there is the "cousin" restaurant just in front, [Shiro
Poporoya](https://goo.gl/maps/JcrwQdwVpHP2).
- **Kebab**: living in Helsinki I often complain about how hard (if not
  impossible) it is to get good kebab here. Fortunately in Milan we don't have
this problem, there is a lot of places, and the kebab is usually good
everywhere. If you're around Citt√† Studi, go to [Le
Piramidi](https://goo.gl/maps/4iH2QwUB9b52) and send my greetings to Luca.
- **Panzerotti**: if you don't know what a panzerotto is: make a small calzone,
  and then *deep fry*. Yes it's *reeally* good. It's commonly known that the
best ones in town are from [Luini](https://goo.gl/maps/nc5LUuccN2D2). Just get
the classic ones, like margherita or salame. Be careful about when you go there,
as in lunch rush hour (12-13) the queue could be several tens of meters long.
- **Fish**: they say that in Milan [you get the freshest fish in
  Italy](http://www.rivistastudio.com/standard/il-mare-a-milano/) (while this
might be a bit of an exaggeration, the fish is usually _really_ fresh. Read the
previous link for reasons why. Works well with GTranslate), so I would be
neglecting something if I didn't mention any fish places (I know, sushi is fish,
but bear with me here). I really like [Il
Pescetto](https://goo.gl/maps/xgPTxZ2QuRH2): trendy, quick, and good selection
of fish and preparations.

## Nightlife

As in, "ok but where do people hang out?". So I guess I'm going to send you to
Navigli. Long story short even though there was not supposed to be any river
going through the city, some Reinassaince big guy wanted Leonardo Da Vinci to
build some channels to connnect the city to the sea ([they actually started much
before that](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigli_(Milano)), but it's an easy
story to tell).  Fast-forward some centuries and we don't need direct sea
connection anymore, but we can reuse these nice channels to host a big
population of mosquitoes and hang out and feel like in Amsterdam.

What to do there?

### Aperitivo

Milan is totally the capital of aperitivo. The concept is like "you go to a bar
around 18-19 with friends, get a Spritz, and have some finger food in the
meanwhile".  In practice things got _a bit_ out of hand, and some places now
serve a pantagruelian delicious buffet, so it's easy to have dinner there.
[Here's a slightly informative article about
it](https://www.walksofitaly.com/blog/food-and-wine/aperitivo-in-italy-what-it-is-and-how-to-enjoy-one).

A nice place with a high concentration of aperitivo places is [Naviglio
Grande](https://goo.gl/maps/J9hGQ9PgUoo). You can pick a place in advance, but
if you don't, there will be some people tring to get you into some place (I
don't know, a place I went often was [this
one](https://goo.gl/maps/UHsB46Tu34L2), but TripAdvisor might have better
suggestions than me on this), but since the competition in the area is high,
almost any place is going to be ok.

### Drinks

So you've eaten, or maybe not, and want to stay in the area to get drinks.
Worry no more:
- **Cocktails**: I really liked [Ginger Cocktail
  Lab](https://goo.gl/maps/RYd23q1u3v12) on [Naviglio
Pavese](https://goo.gl/maps/S9997JinkeT2), and they apparently have also
aperitivo. At this point I have to mention also the [Nottingham
Forest](https://goo.gl/maps/FXvVxLRdBwL2), as it's THE place for cocktails in
Milan.  Unfortunately I never managed to get in there (it's REALLY crowded all
the time), so you'll have to figure out. They say it's really good.
- **Beer**: the awesome [BQ](https://goo.gl/maps/4agxNjZx6nF2) will satisfy any
  craft beer nerd. It's good. See also the [breweries section in case you missed
that](#breweries).
- **Wine**: there is a bunch of nice small wineries with affordable prices (I
  mean, you have to fit the style) around the area, e.g. [this
one](https://goo.gl/maps/Myd1cyM94cR2) and [this
one](https://goo.gl/maps/FGTA1xuWH5t).

## But...how about..the shopping?

Right. You want to go either to [Corso Vittorio Emanuele
II](https://goo.gl/maps/fAYyngN4u6q) or [Corso Buenos
Aires](https://goo.gl/maps/8zvzafGE1Fx). If you're into fashion, I assume you
already know about [Via Monte Napoleone](https://goo.gl/maps/1Dmyi9dZLv62). If
you're not, it's still worth it to go there just for the laughs.

## Actually, how about strolling around

If you read up to this point, it could be that you are interested in just
strolling around the city and seeing monuments and nice things and stuff.  I
like walking around the city, so I can advise some nice targeted and
landmarks-intense paths:
- **Duomo-Navigli**: Starting from [Duomo](https://goo.gl/maps/QGWM6pSUSMp), go
  through [Via Torino](https://goo.gl/maps/rcgJrxF9ZfQ2) (some amount of nice
shops, [hidden art](https://goo.gl/maps/cN8T7NSAAan), etc.),
[Colonnne](https://goo.gl/maps/qT6mz9pYXez), [Porta
Ticinese](https://goo.gl/maps/F9saPF6mEvM2), and then stroll both Naviglio
Grande and Naviglio Pavese (be careful that they are not parallel).
- **Duomo-Brera-Garibaldi**: Starting from Duomo, visit the
  [Galleria](https://goo.gl/maps/BHEN7x3tijo), you cannot miss [La
Scala](https://goo.gl/maps/7KnFt9vrct22), and then proceed to Brera: you might
be interested in the [Pinacoteca](https://goo.gl/maps/GRKiK2rvVek) and [Orto
Botanico](https://goo.gl/maps/X9pD8DeXrzu). Then go towards
[Moscova](https://goo.gl/maps/QwL4ZoLfTtM2), have a cannolo and a coffee
somewhere, and proceed to [Porta Garibaldi](https://goo.gl/maps/J8iuAH6619p).
You then want to go through [Corso Como](https://goo.gl/maps/qSH2jE9fKFx) (a
really trendy place for some reason), and finally [Piazza Gae
Aulenti](https://goo.gl/maps/2ufwcNDkYhp). Have an [ice cream
there](https://goo.gl/maps/rG4rhVhtNix).
- **Sempione**: Starting from..yes Duomo, get to
  [Castello](https://goo.gl/maps/tg3Zp1HNSTE2). Cross that, and you get to
[Parco Sempione](https://goo.gl/maps/DvMqzrvy59C2). It's the biggest park of the
center, and it's very nice to chill in there for a while. If you cross it
entirely, you get to [Arco della Pace](https://goo.gl/maps/E3S6UAvWjVB2), and
end up in Corso Sempione, which is also full of nice places to have aperitivo.


Buon appetito! üòé
