Creating a new blog, experiment #934785.

We have some good auspices this time, usually I don't get as far as posting the first article!

I'll write mostly about Software Stuffâ„¢ (since hey, that's what I think about for like ten hours a day) - like Clojure, Distributed Systems, Crypto, Linux, various hacks - but I'd also love to put on paper some "people matters", like *meta-meditations* about life and the universe, opinions on world news and why not also some politics.

See you soon :beers::bowtie::ok_hand:
