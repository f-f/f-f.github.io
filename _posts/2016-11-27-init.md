Creating a new blog, experiment #934785.

We have some good auspices this time, usually I don't get as far as posting the first article!

I'll write mostly about whatever Software Stuffâ„¢ I might fancy at the moment (since hey, that's
what I think about for most of my waking time) - like Functional Programming, Programming Languages,
Distributed Systems, Crypto, hardware stuff, rockets, random hacks - but I might also
put "on paper" some softer matters, like *meta-meditations* about life and the
universe, economics, and - last but not least - cooking and food.

See you soon ðŸ‘‹
