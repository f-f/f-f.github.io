<img style="width:300px; height:300px; border-radius:160px;" src="/assets/img/small-profile.jpg" alt="Hi there!">

I come from the beautiful [Sardinia][sardinia], but these days I'm living in
[Helsinki, Finland][helsinki] (you know, they have [sauna][sauna] in here)

This page is supposed to be an informal summary of what I love, what I did and what I do currently.
If you're interested in a more "professionally looking document", check out my
[constantly-outdated CV][cv].

### Tech

It's possible that you stumbled on some of my work in **PureScript**, **Haskell** or **Clojure**.

In fact, I often contribute to open source software.  
The projects I'm currently involved in are:
- [spago][spago], PureScript package manager and build tool
- [dhall-lang][dhall-lang], a programmable configuration language that is not Turing-complete
- [dhall-clj][dhall-clj], native Clojure integration for Dhall
- [dhall-kubernetes][dhall-kubernetes]: integration between Kubernetes and Dhall

I also speak at conferences sometimes. My last recorded talks have been:
- **"Write yourself a compiler in Clojure: Dhall edition"**  
  Clojure Meetup, Helsinki - 2019-01-14 ([video][dhall-clj-video], [slides][dhall-clj-slides], [code][dhall-clj-code])
- **"Purely Functional DevOps with Dhall"**  
  Small FP Conf, Helsinki 2018-09-13 ([video][dhall-devops-video], [slides][dhall-devops-slides])

### Music

I like to make music. [This is the last record I produced and mostly composed][litd] (you might
fancy it if you're into post-rock or prog-rock)

### Of course, food

Stereotypically enough, I very much like making food (spoiler: it's way more predictable than
software even though it's much more fuzzy!) and [baking][sourdough], and so on üçï
